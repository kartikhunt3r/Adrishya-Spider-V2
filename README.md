# Adrishya-Spider-V2
this version is with some minor changes, the main change is on output files. V2 is ready to integrate with your recon process. unlike V1, which is prompting for inputs, this version will run on a single command, also i removed identification from output files, so you will now get pure urls as a output, which you can use for your further recon.
